    <h2>You step into a long dining room, where cobwebs hang from the ceiling and the air feels stale. A large table is set for a meal that was never eaten, its surface covered with dust. You need a break and at the far end of the room you pick up the cleanest wine bottle and take a big gulp, because you deserve a little help. You continue on your way to possibly find a way out of this cursed house.</h2>
